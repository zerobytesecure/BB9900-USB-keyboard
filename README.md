## Features
### Hardware:

The keyboard has not only keys but also includes an optical navigation trackpad, which located in the upper-middle area. This optical navigation sensor can function as a mouse or a scroll wheel. The whole keyboard has backlighting, and the optical navigation button area also has backlighting. In the default firmware, when the Caps Lock is enabled, the backlight for the optical navigation trackpad will be turned on; when Caps Lock is disabled, the backlight for the optical navigation will be turned off. Additionally, the keyboard backlight can be manually toggled on or off. On the side of the USB Type-C female port, there are two additional side buttons that provide extra key functions and enhance ergonomics.

### customize your own keymap:

Due to the limited number of keys on the keyboard, the default firmware has configured the two keys in the bottom right corner to serve as the second and third layer activation keys. Since everyone has its varying preferences and interpretations of their keyboard layouts, it may be necessary to customize the key layout and keycode for this keyboard. The default firmware supports online key remapping through [VIA](https://www.caniusevia.com).
